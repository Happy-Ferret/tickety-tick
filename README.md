# bitcrowd ticketsystem helper

This chrome extension helps to handle commits and branches the bitcrowd way.

We have bookmarklets to create a unique mapping between tickets and their git branches. This extension does the same in a nicer way.

Currently supported ticket systems:

* Pivotaltracker
* Jira
